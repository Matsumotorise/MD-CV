# Code/Projects
+ [MD-CV](https://github.com/Matsumotorise/MD-CV)
    : Synced resume using PanDoc, CSS, and Markdown. PanDoc converts .md syntax into .pdf and .html. CSS styles the generated website.
+ [movingCharacter](https://github.com/Matsumotorise/movingCharacter)
    : A tile game using Java's JFrame. Animations, On-Player camera, Sprinting, and basic collision detection are implemented.
+ [Dreambot-Scripts](https://github.com/Matsumotorise/DreamBot-Scripts) & [Runemate-Scripts](https://github.com/Matsumotorise/Runemate-Scripts)
    : Bots for Oldschool Runescape with basic anti-ban support.
    
## Usual Workflow
+ I am running Arch Linux with LXDE/Openbox with tiling script keybinds and Tilda as my terminal emulator.
+ For development, I use Webstorm, CLion, InteliJ, and PyCharm in my programming. These JetBrains products support Vim-emulation, Git integration, and other plugins that keeps the development environment comfortable while retaining IDE generation.
